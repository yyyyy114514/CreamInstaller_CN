### [Revived] CreamInstaller: Automatic DLC Unlocker Installer & Configuration Generator

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller?label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/releases/latest) [![CI Build](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/actions/workflows/ci-builds.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/actions/workflows/ci-builds.yml)

![Program Preview Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/main/preview.png)

###### **NOTE:** This is simply a preview image; this is not a list of supported games nor configurations!

##### The program utilizes the latest version of [CreamAPI](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576) by [deadmau5](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576). It also utilizes the latest versions of [SmokeAPI](https://github.com/acidicoala/SmokeAPI), [Koaloader](https://github.com/acidicoala/Koaloader), [ScreamAPI](https://github.com/acidicoala/ScreamAPI), [Uplay R1 Unlocker](https://github.com/acidicoala/UplayR1Unlocker) and [Uplay R2 Unlocker](https://github.com/acidicoala/UplayR2Unlocker), all by [acidicoala](https://github.com/acidicoala). All unlockers are downloaded and embedded into the program itself; no further downloads necessary on your part!
---
#### Description:
Automatically finds all installed Steam, Epic and Ubisoft games with their respective DLC-related DLL locations on the user's computer,
parses SteamCMD, Steam Store and Epic Games Store for user-selected games' DLCs, then provides a very simple graphical interface
utilizing the gathered information for the maintenance of DLC unlockers.

The primary function of the program is to **automatically generate and install DLC unlockers** for whichever
games and DLCs the user selects; however, through the use of **right-click context menus** the user can also:
* automatically repair the Paradox Launcher
* open parsed Steam and/or Epic Games appinfo in Notepad(++)
* refresh parsed Steam and/or Epic Games appinfo
* open root game directories and important DLL directories in Explorer
* open SteamDB, ScreamDB, Steam Store, Epic Games Store, Steam Community, Ubisoft Store, and official game website links (where applicable) in the default browser

---
#### Features:
* Automatic download and installation of SteamCMD as necessary whenever a Steam game is chosen. *For gathering appinfo such as name, buildid, listofdlc, depots, etc.*
* Automatic gathering and caching of information for all selected Steam and Epic games and **ALL** of their DLCs.
* Automatic DLL installation and configuration generation for CreamAPI, Koaloader, ScreamAPI, Uplay R1 Unlocker and Uplay R2 Unlocker.
* Automatic uninstallation of DLLs and configurations for CreamAPI, Koaloader, SmokeAPI, ScreamAPI, Uplay R1 Unlocker and Uplay R2 Unlocker.
* Automatic reparation of the Paradox Launcher (and manually via the right-click context menu "Repair" option). *For when the launcher updates whilst you have CreamAPI, SmokeAPI or ScreamAPI installed to it.*

<details>
<summary>Expand for more info on CI Builds</summary>

- CreamInstaller is automatically built and tested using GitHub Actions on every push to the **main** branch. You can view all recent CI build runs by clicking the status badge at the top or here: [![CI Build](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/actions/workflows/ci-builds.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/actions/workflows/ci-builds.yml)

</details>

---
#### Installation:
1. Click [here](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller/releases/latest/download/CreamInstaller.exe) to download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller).
2. Move the executable to anywhere on your computer you want. *It's completely self-contained.*

If the program doesn't seem to launch, try downloading and installing [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.7](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/bb581716-4cca-466e-9857-512e2371734b/5fe261422a7305171866fd7812d0976f/windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.7-win-x64.exe) and restarting your computer. Note that the program currently only supports Windows 10+ 64-bit machines as seen [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/supported-os.md).

---
#### Usage:
1. Start the program executable. *Read above under Installation if it doesn't launch.*
2. Choose which programs and/or games the program should scan for DLC. *The program automatically gathers all installed games from Steam, Epic and Ubisoft directories.*
3. Wait for the program to download and install SteamCMD (if you chose a Steam game). *Very fast, depends on internet speed.*
4. Wait for the program to gather and cache the chosen games' information & DLCs. *May take a good amount of time on the first run, depends on how many games you chose and how many DLCs they have.*
5. **CAREFULLY** select which games' DLCs you wish to unlock. *Obviously none of the DLC unlockers are tested for every single game!*
6. Choose whether or not to install in Proxy mode, and if so then also pick the proxy DLL to use. *If the default winmm.dll doesn't work, then see [here](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2552172#p2552172) to find one that does.*
7. Click the **Generate and Install** button.
8. Click the **OK** button to close the program.
9. If any of the DLC unlockers cause problems with any of the games you installed them on, simply go back to step 5 and select what games you wish you **revert** changes to, and instead click the **Uninstall** button this time.

##### **NOTE:** This program does not automatically download nor install actual DLC files for you; as the title of the program states, this program is only a *DLC Unlocker* installer. Should the game you wish to unlock DLC for not already come with the DLCs installed, as is the case with a good majority of games, you must find, download and install those to the game yourself. This process includes manually installing new DLCs and manually updating the previously manually installed DLCs after game updates.

# FAQ / Common Issues

### The program won't launch

<details>
<summary>Click to expand for troubleshooting steps</summary>

Check the following in order:

1. **System requirements**: Windows 10+ 64-bit only ([.NET 8 Supported OS List](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/supported-os.md))
2. **Extract before running**: Ensure you've extracted the executable from the ZIP file
3. **Antivirus**: Add an exception for CreamInstaller (see [False Positives](#false-positive-antivirus-detections) below)
4. **Runtime**: Install [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller#installation) and restart your computer

If none of these work, your system may not support .NET 8 or may have underlying system issues.

### DLCs aren't unlocking in my game

<details>
<summary>Click to expand for troubleshooting steps</summary>

CreamInstaller only installs DLC **unlockers** it does **not** guarantee they will work for every game.

If the program successfully installs the unlockers but DLCs still aren't unlocking, this is **not an issue with CreamInstaller itself** and isn't something I can directly fix. DLC Unlocker compatibility and behavior vary from game to game.

**DLC Files:** _This program does **not** automatically download or install actual DLC files for you. As the name implies, it is only a *DLC unlocker installer*. If the game you wish to unlock DLC for does not already include the DLC files (which is the case for many games), you must manually obtain and install those files yourself. This includes manually installing new DLCs and manually updating or reinstalling previously installed DLCs after game updates._

If you're having trouble, try the following:

- Review the [Usage section](https://github.com/FroggMaster/CreamInstaller#usage) for proper setup  
- Visit the [CS.RIN.RU forum](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=10) for game-specific troubleshooting and compatibility info

### My antivirus detects CreamInstaller as a virus (False Positives)

<a name="false-positive-antivirus-detections"></a>

**These are false positives.** See the detailed explanation below:
<details>
<summary>Click to expand for information about false positives</summary>

## Why Antivirus Software Flags CreamInstaller

CreamInstaller is **not a virus**, but it's commonly flagged because of its functionality:

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **DLL modification** | Replaces game DLLs to unlock content behavior similar to some malware |
| **Process hooking** | Embedded DLC unlockers interact with Steam/Epic/Ubisoft/game processes |
| **Compressed executable** | Single file executables are often associated with packed malware |
| **Not code-signed** | No Extended Validation certificate ($300–500/year) means lower AV reputation (**I will not be paying for this**) |
| **Misc** | Game modding tools frequently trigger heuristic detections regardless of intent |

## Common False Positive Names

| Detection Name | What It Usually Means / Why It’s a False Positive |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Mamson.A!ac | Generic heuristic detection; often triggered by packed or obfuscated executables |
| Phonzy.A!ml | Machine learning detection; flags unusual behavior patterns |
| Wacatac.H!ml | Extremely common false positive; triggered by compressed or self-updating programs |
| Malgent!MSR | Generic Microsoft label for “suspicious behavior,” not confirmed malware |
| Tiggre!rfn | Heuristic runtime detection often seen with tools that hook processes |
| UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic | Reputation based detection for tools that *can* be abused |
| Trojan.Win64.Agent | Very broad category; common false positive for unsigned binaries |
| Trojan.Win64.Agent.oa!s1 | Cloud/AI heuristic variant of the above |
| Backdoor.Agent | Heuristic detection for applications that download remote content, extract archives, spawn processes, and self-replace. |

### How do I find a working proxy DLL for my game?

<details>
<summary>Click to expand for full walkthrough</summary>

If CreamInstaller's default proxy mode (winmm.dll) doesn't work for your game, you may need to proxy a different DLL one that the game already attempts to load on its own. The easiest way to discover which DLLs your game tries to load is **Process Monitor (ProcMon)** from Microsoft Sysinternals.

This method reveals:

- Which DLL names the game attempts to load.
- The exact directories being searched.
- Which DLLs are missing from those locations.
- The right DLL name to select in CreamInstaller's proxy mode.

#### Prerequisites

Download and run **Process Monitor (ProcMon)** from Microsoft Sysinternals. Running ProcMon **as Administrator** is required to capture all process and file events.

#### Step 1: Launch Process Monitor

Start ProcMon. Clear any pre-existing events using **Ctrl + X** or **Edit → Clear Display**.

#### Step 2: Configure Filters

Open the filter dialog with **Ctrl + L** and add the following filters:

| Column | Relation | Value | Action |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Process Name | contains | `<GameName>` | Include |
| Result | contains | NAME NOT FOUND | Include |
| Path | ends with | dll | Include |

Replace `<GameName>` with part of the game executable name e.g., `Risk of Rain` for `Risk of Rain 2.exe`.
<img width="1454" height="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39aeef36-207f-40fa-bdd9-2f7a34c1cdda" />

#### Step 3: Start Capturing

1. Click the capture event button (Play button with pause symbol or **Ctrl + E**).
2. Launch the game.
3. Wait until startup completes or the main menu appears.

ProcMon will record every DLL load attempt matching your filters.

#### Step 4: Examine Missing DLLs

Look for entries with:
- `Result: NAME NOT FOUND`
- A path within the game's installation directory

These entries indicate the game searched for those DLLs but did not find them exactly the kind of load attempt a proxy DLL can hook into.

Example output:

```
GameFolder\version.dll
GameFolder\winmm.dll
GameFolder\winhttp.dll
```

#### Step 5: Identify Your Proxy DLL Candidate

The recorded paths reveal exactly where the game expects each DLL to exist and which DLL names it looks for.

If ProcMon shows:

```
C:\Games\ExampleGame\version.dll   NAME NOT FOUND
```
Then the game attempted to load `version.dll` from its own directory. **That DLL name is your proxy candidate** select it in CreamInstaller's "Proxy DLL" dropdown when installing.
The below example image shows all the proxy DLL names available for Risk of Rain 2. 
<img width="1199" height="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/724f3e46-1d51-4438-bca4-af8b38f70c7f" />

#### Common Proxy DLLs Found in Games

| DLL | Commonly Used By |
|-----|-----------------|
| `winmm.dll` | Many Steam games CreamInstaller's default |
| `version.dll` | Unreal Engine 4/5 games Koaloader's default |
| `winhttp.dll` | Games and applications that use Windows HTTP Services (networking, authentication, telemetry, updates) |

The right choice entirely depends on what your specific game attempts to load use the ProcMon steps above to find it.

#### Next Steps

Once you've identified a candidate DLL name via ProcMon, re-run CreamInstaller, select that game, check the **Proxy** option, and pick that same DLL name from the dropdown. CreamInstaller will handle the rest naming the unlocker DLL correctly and placing it in the right directory.

### Steam API DLL Verification / Failed to Load SteamAPI DLL

<details>
<summary>Click to expand for troubleshooting steps</summary>

If you encounter errors related to `steam_api.dll` or `steam_api64.dll`, such as:

- `Digital signature check failed for Steam_api.dll`
- `Failed to load SteamAPI`
- `Failed to initialize SteamAPI`
- `steam_api.dll or steam_api64.dll is damaged`

These errors indicate that the Steam API DLL in your game's directory has been modified. This is expected when DLC unlockers replace the original Steam API DLL. The solutions below avoid touching the original DLL entirely.

#### Solutions

**Option 1: Use Proxy Mode**
When running CreamInstaller, enable the **Proxy** option and select a proxy DLL (e.g., `winmm.dll`). This keeps the original `steam_api.dll`/`steam_api64.dll` completely untouched. The unlocker is loaded indirectly through the proxy DLL, so the game still finds a valid, signed Steam API DLL.

**Option 2: Use CreamAPI with Extra Protection**
If you are using CreamAPI, enable the **Extra Protection** option in CreamInstaller. This configures CreamAPI to wrap the original Steam API DLL and return the original dll where needed, preventing signature verification errors while still unlocking DLCs.

#### Antivirus / False Positives

If your antivirus quarantines the unlocker DLL or interferes with the installation, add exclusions for your game folder and CreamInstaller. See the [False Positives](#false-positive-antivirus-detections) section above for details.
